## LCAC Framework - Least-Context Access Control

**Author:** Quinton Stackfield  
**Organization:** Atom Labs  
**License:** MIT  

**Purpose:**  
Define a cognitive-layer security model that governs information flow, memory, and reasoning boundaries within autonomous AI systems.

---

## Overview

Least-Context Access Control (LCAC) extends the principles of Zero Trust into the cognitive layer.  
It is designed to secure reasoning itself, governing what an AI system can *know*, *remember*, or *transfer across contexts*.

LCAC establishes the foundation for the emerging field of **Cognitive Security**, enabling controlled reasoning and bounded autonomy in self-governing AI systems.  
Where Zero Trust governs identity and action, LCAC governs cognition and inference.

---

## Motivation

As AI systems move from reactive models to autonomous reasoning agents, the attack surface has shifted.  
Compromise no longer occurs only through identity or network intrusion, but through **contextual contamination**. Where an agent carries or infers knowledge across domains in unintended ways.

LCAC addresses this by enforcing **reasoning isolation**, ensuring every inference occurs within a bounded context of trust.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cognitive Least Privilege** | Limit what an AI agent can know or recall based on its contextual authorization. |
| **Reasoning Isolation** | Prevent inference drift by isolating reasoning chains within defined trust zones. |
| **Cognitive Integrity** | Guarantee that inferences are traceable, verifiable, and free from unauthorized contextual blending. |
| **Runtime Governance** | Embed ethical alignment, compliance, and decision transparency directly into system logic. |
| **Contextual Trust Anchors** | Replace static permissions with dynamic, evidence-based reasoning limits. |

---

## Architecture Overview

LCAC introduces a **Cognitive Control Plane** above traditional Model and Data Control Planes.  
This layer mediates the flow of context, reasoning, and knowledge between AI agents, ensuring cognitive operations remain within authorized boundaries.

### Control Layers
- **Data Plane:** Manages storage, retrieval, and access to factual data.  
- **Model Plane:** Manages algorithmic inference, policy, and functional execution.  
- **Cognitive Plane (LCAC):** Governs reasoning, contextual recall, and information blending between agents.

Each reasoning event is treated as a **bounded transaction**.  
LCAC verifies cognitive integrity before and after inference, ensuring no cross-context contamination or reasoning drift occurs.

## Specification Summary

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scope Control** | Applies contextual access limits to memory and reasoning layers. |
| **Inference Isolation** | Each reasoning chain executes within its own trust boundary. |
| **Auditability** | All inference events are recorded with provenance and reasoning traceability. |
| **Dynamic Revocation** | Reasoning sessions can be terminated or redacted when trust thresholds are exceeded. |
| **Trust Metric** | Each agent maintains a Cognitive Trust Score based on reasoning alignment and policy adherence. |

## Relationship to Other Models

LCAC **complements** but does not replace Zero Trust.  
While Zero Trust secures *action and access*, LCAC secures *knowledge and reasoning*.

It extends naturally into:
- **Cognitive Security:** Defining reasoning as a protected surface.  
- **AI Governance:** Providing auditable, runtime enforcement of ethical constraints.  
- **Agent Autonomy:** Enabling self-governing reasoning processes under verifiable constraints.

---

## Future Work

The next phase of research expands LCAC into the **Cognitive Security Stack**, integrating:

- Policy-based reasoning isolation for distributed agent systems.  
- Reinforcement mechanisms for ethical runtime verification.  
- Secure multi-agent collaboration models governed by LCAC principles.
