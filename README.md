## Overview
Least-Context Access Control (LCAC) extends the principles of Zero Trust into the cognitive layer.  
It is designed to secure reasoning itself—governing what an AI system can know, remember, or transfer across contexts.  

LCAC establishes the foundation for the emerging field of **Cognitive Security**, enabling controlled reasoning and bounded autonomy in self-governing AI systems.  
Where Zero Trust governs identity and action, LCAC governs cognition and inference.

## Motivation
As AI systems move from reactive models to autonomous reasoning agents, the attack surface has shifted.  
Compromise no longer occurs only through identity or network intrusion, but through **contextual contamination**—where an agent carries or infers knowledge across domains in unintended ways.  

LCAC addresses this by enforcing **reasoning isolation**, ensuring every inference occurs within a bounded context of trust.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Cognitive Least Privilege** | Limit what an AI agent can know or recall based on its contextual authorization. |
| **Reasoning Isolation** | Prevent inference drift by isolating reasoning chains within defined trust zones. |
| **Cognitive Integrity** | Guarantee that inferences are traceable, verifiable, and free from unauthorized contextual blending. |
| **Runtime Governance** | Embed ethical alignment, compliance, and decision transparency directly into system logic. |
| **Contextual Trust Anchors** | Replace static permissions with dynamic, evidence-based reasoning limits. |

## Architecture Overview

LCAC introduces a **Cognitive Control Plane** above traditional Model and Data Control Planes.  
This layer mediates the flow of context, reasoning, and knowledge between AI agents, ensuring cognitive operations remain within authorized boundaries.
