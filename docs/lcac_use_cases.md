# LCAC Use Cases

## 1. Secure Reasoning in AI Assistants
LCAC prevents cross-user data leakage by isolating reasoning memory between sessions.

## 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
Agents collaborate through verified cognitive boundaries-sharing only context-safe data under LCAC policies.

## 3. Cognitive Red Teaming
Security teams simulate cognitive intrusions to test reasoning drift, contextual contamination, and inference-boundary bypass.

## 4. Financial and Autonomous Decisioning
In algorithmic trading or autonomous operations, LCAC ensures that strategic reasoning remains bounded by authorized market or mission contexts.

## 5. AI Governance and Compliance
LCAC enables runtime explainability, supporting compliance with emerging AI governance and auditing standards.
