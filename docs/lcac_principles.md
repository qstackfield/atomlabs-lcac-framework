LCAC Principles Detailed Explanation


1. Cognitive Least Privilege

Traditional systems limit who can act. LCAC limits what can be known.
An AI agent’s memory, context window, and external recall functions are governed by contextual authorization. The principle ensures that knowledge access is not cumulative across reasoning events,  preventing cognitive privilege escalation.

2. Reasoning Isolation

LCAC enforces contextual boundaries between reasoning sessions.
Each inference chain operates in a defined “trust zone” with its own reasoning memory. This prevents contamination between unrelated tasks and ensures alignment integrity in multi-agent or federated reasoning systems.

3. Cognitive Integrity

Every inference must be verifiable and reconstructable.
LCAC establishes inference traceability through signed reasoning checkpoints and memory provenance tracking, ensuring no unauthorized data blending occurs during reasoning flow.

⸻

4. Runtime Governance

Governance exists as a runtime enforcement function, not an external audit.
Ethical alignment, compliance, and transparency are embedded directly in the system logic-enabling continuous verification of reasoning behavior and decisions.

5. Contextual Trust Anchors

LCAC replaces static trust permissions with adaptive, evidence-based reasoning limits.
Each agent’s reasoning scope evolves dynamically based on context confidence, provenance quality, and historical integrity-forming the basis of Cognitive Trust Scoring.

Summary

Together, these principles establish LCAC as the foundation of the Cognitive Security Stack-securing not just access and data, but thought itself.
