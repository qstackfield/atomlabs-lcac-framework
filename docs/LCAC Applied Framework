1. Introduction - From Framework to Application

LCAC (Least-Context Access Control) extends Zero Trust beyond identity and access into reasoning itself.
It was designed to solve a fundamental problem: as AI systems evolve from predictive models to autonomous agents, the attack surface has shifted from data to cognition.

Traditional Zero Trust architectures secured who can act and what they can access. LCAC secures what they can know.
It governs reasoning boundaries, memory recall, and cross-context inference — enforcing isolation at the cognitive layer of AI systems.

This document outlines how LCAC can be applied across multiple industries, securing AI cognition where it matters most — from clinical reasoning in healthcare to intelligence coordination in defense.

Zero Trust governs actions. LCAC governs awareness.

2. LCAC in Healthcare

The Challenge

Healthcare AI systems don’t just process data — they reason about human lives.
From diagnostic assistants to hospital logistics models, many systems learn patterns across multiple patients or departments.
When reasoning boundaries blur, one patient’s context can unintentionally inform another’s outcome.
This creates hidden risk - cognitive leakage, context bias, and non-compliant reasoning chains that violate medical data integrity.

The LCAC Solution

LCAC enforces cognitive isolation between patient contexts.
Each diagnostic reasoning event occurs within a bounded cognitive trust zone, with context-specific permissions that limit memory recall and inference transfer.
The result is safer, context-aware clinical reasoning - free from bias and unauthorized recall.

Outcome
	•	Isolated reasoning per patient or case
	•	Verifiable diagnostic reasoning traceability
	•	AI systems that learn without leaking and adapt without bias

Zero Trust protected patient data. LCAC protects patient reasoning.

3. LCAC in Biotech and Drug Discovery

The Challenge

Drug discovery models no longer just crunch molecular data — they reason about biological relationships.
That reasoning can unintentionally mix proprietary chemistry with open-source or shared datasets, creating intellectual property risk and regulatory exposure.

The LCAC Solution

LCAC isolates reasoning across compound families, vendor datasets, and research pipelines.
Each inference is bounded by a contextual authorization layer, ensuring that synthetic logic cannot cross-pollinate across organizations or confidentiality domains.

Outcome
	•	Enforces reproducibility in AI-driven research
	•	Prevents reasoning bleed between data sources
	•	Protects IP while accelerating discovery

Zero Trust protected the lab. LCAC protects the logic behind the lab.
