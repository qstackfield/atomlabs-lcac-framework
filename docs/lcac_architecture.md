# LCAC Architecture Overview

## Cognitive Control Plane
LCAC introduces a **Cognitive Control Plane** positioned above the Model and Data Control Planes.

### Control Layers
- **Data Plane:** Manages factual data storage and retrieval.  
- **Model Plane:** Manages algorithmic inference and functional logic.  
- **Cognitive Plane (LCAC):** Governs reasoning, contextual recall, and cross-context knowledge flow.

Each inference transaction passes through LCACâ€™s **Cognitive Boundary Module**, which validates:
1. Context authenticity  
2. Reasoning scope and duration  
3. Cognitive trust thresholds  

---

## Enforcement Flow
1. **Request Stage:** An agent initiates reasoning with a declared context and purpose.  
2. **Authorization Stage:** LCAC validates contextual access and creates an ephemeral reasoning container.  
3. **Inference Stage:** Reasoning proceeds with enforced isolation and dynamic monitoring.  
4. **Verification Stage:** LCAC audits inference output for cognitive drift or context violation.  
5. **Termination Stage:** Reasoning state is cleared; only approved insights persist.

## Implementation Components
- **Context Tokenization Layer:** Encodes and verifies context boundaries.  
- **Reasoning Isolator:** Manages separate cognitive sandboxes per reasoning task.  
- **Cognitive Audit Log:** Captures verifiable reasoning provenance for downstream governance.  
- **Trust Engine:** Computes dynamic trust scores and adapts boundaries accordingly.
